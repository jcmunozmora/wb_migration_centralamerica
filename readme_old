## Sampling Design - Theory

The survey follows a **multi‑stage, probability‑proportional‑to‑size (PPS) design** with *villages* as primary sampling units (PSUs) and *households* as ultimate sampling units (USUs). Stratification combines four **fragility typologies** (defined by conflict and climate‑risk scores) with **household‑head gender**, guaranteeing both geographical coverage and statistical power for key sub‑groups such as female‑headed households.

## Fixed‑Sample‑Size → Minimum Detectable Effect

Operational constraints often limit the total number of households that can be interviewed. Rather than fixing a minimum detectable effect (MDE) first, we invert the problem:

> **Given a feasible total sample size $N_{\text{total}}$, what is the *smallest effect* (MDE) that can be detected with 80 % power at $\alpha = 0.05$ once oversampling, covariate adjustment, and clustering are taken into account?**

The script **`code/R/power_reverse.R`** automates this conversion:

1. **Remove inflation factors**

   $$
   n_{\text{eff}}\;=\;\frac{N_{\text{total}}}{\bigl(1+\text{oversample}\bigr)\,\text{DEFF}_{\text{cluster}}}\;\times\;(1-R^{2}),
   $$

   producing the *effective* per‑group size expected by the `pwr` package.
2. **Solve for the effect size.**

   * Binary outcomes – root‑find on Cohen’s *h* with `pwr.2p.test()`, then convert back to an absolute risk difference.
   * Continuous outcome – root‑find on Cohen’s *d* with `pwr.t.test()`, then multiply by the outcome’s standard deviation.
3. **Return an MDE grid** for a range of candidate $N_{\text{total}}$ values (default: 800 – 5 000 households).

The figure `img/WB_MDE_vs_N.png` visualises how detectable effects shrink as the total sample size grows.

### `01_Sampling_Design.R` – what the script does

`01_Sampling_Design.R` takes a *grid of candidate total sample sizes*, applies the oversampling, clustering, and covariate‑adjustment factors in reverse, and then solves the power equations to obtain the **minimum detectable effect (MDE)** for each outcome.

* **Outputs**

  * `img/WB_MDE_vs_N.png` – a visual map of how the MDE declines as the total sample size increases.
  * `data/derived/mde_grid.csv` – a tidy table listing `Outcome`, `N_total`, and the corresponding `MDE`.

These artefacts guide the final choice of total households and cluster configuration without prescribing any particular effect size ex‑ante. The sample-size calculation is based on the following equation for the two **food-insecurity** and **migration** outcomes (binary outcomes).

### Binary outcome

$$
 n \;=\; \bigl(Z_{\alpha/2}+Z_{\beta}\bigr)^2
     \frac{p_{1}(1-p_{1}) + p_{2}(1-p_{2})}{(p_{2}-p_{1})^{2}}
     \times \frac{1}{1-R^{2}}.
$$

* **n** – required sample size per study arm
* $Z_{\alpha/2}=1.96$ (95 % confidence)
* $Z_{\beta}=0.84$ (80 % power)
* $p_{2}=p_{1}+\text{MDE}$
* $R^{2}$ – share of outcome variance explained by covariates

### Continuous outcome (dietary‑diversity score)

$$
 n \;=\; \frac{2\bigl(Z_{\alpha/2}+Z_{\beta}\bigr)^{2}\,\sigma^{2}}{\text{MDE}^{2}}\times \frac{1}{1-R^{2}},
$$

with residual variance $\sigma^{2}_{z}=\sigma^{2}(1-R^{2})$.

### Clustering and design effect

Because households are sampled in villages, statistical efficiency depends on the **intra‑cluster correlation** *(ICC)*. So, to determine the number of households per village cluster we must minimise **intra-cluster correlation** effects. This involves striking a balance between the number of clusters and the number of households within each cluster.

A key concept in this process is the **Design Effect (DEFF)**, which measures the loss of statistical efficiency resulting from clustering.

#### Design Effect (DEFF)

The **design effect** compares the variance of an estimator under the actual (cluster) design with the variance that would have been obtained from a simple random sample (SRS) of the same total size.  
For a single-stage cluster sample with roughly equal cluster sizes, the design effect that captures the loss of efficiency caused by clustering is:

$$
\text{DEFF}_{\text{cluster}}\;=\;1 + (m-1)\,\rho,\qquad\text{or}\qquad1 + (\bar m-1)\,\rho(1+\text{CV}_{m}^{2})\text{ for unequal clusters.}
$$

* $m$ – average households per cluster
* $\rho$ – ICC

##### Accounting for survey weights

If sampling weights are applied, the overall design effect is the product of the clustering and weighting components:

$$
\text{DEFF}_{\text{total}}\;=\;\text{DEFF}_{\text{cluster}}\bigl(1+\text{CV}_{w}^{2}\bigr),
$$

where $\text{CV}_{w}$ is the coefficient of variation of the final weights.

## Incorporation of Fragility and Gender Strata

To ensure the sample design reflects the complexity of the population, the stratification incorporates two critical dimensions—**gender** and **fragility**.  
The prevalence of each typology in the population was used to determine stratum proportions, guaranteeing sufficient representation to detect meaningful differences across groups.

### 1  Gender Stratum  
Within each fragility typology, the sample is further stratified by household gender type, distinguishing between **female-headed** and **male-headed** (80 %) households.  
Sample sizes are adjusted so that gender-specific subgroups are adequately represented.

### 2  Fragility-Typology Stratum  
The primary stratum defines **four fragility categories** based on **climate risk** and **conflict** levels.

#### Conflict exposure  
*Indicators:* number of battles, protests, riots, acts of violence against civilians, and fatalities from these events.  
A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is run on these variables, using the median score as the cut-off: departments scoring **above** the median are classified as **high-risk** for violence, while those **below** the median are **low-risk** (see Appendix 1 for details).

#### Climate-risk exposure  
*Indicators:* water stress in crops and livestock, probability of droughts affecting crops, and probability of droughts affecting livestock.  
A PCA is conducted using the same median-based classification: departments **above** the median are **high-risk** for climate change, and those **below** are **low-risk** (see Appendix 1).

Based on the two PCAs, we define **four typologies**:

* **Higher Climate Risk & Conflict-Affected**  
  Departments with climate-risk values above the median **and** high exposure to conflict.

* **Higher Climate Risk & Non-Conflict-Affected**  
  Departments highly exposed and vulnerable to climate change **but not** affected by conflict.

* **Lower Climate Risk & Conflict-Affected**  
  Departments less exposed and vulnerable to climate change **but** highly affected by conflict.

* **Lower Climate Risk & Non-Conflict-Affected**  
  Departments less exposed and vulnerable to climate change **and** not affected by conflict.

## Sampling design -- Results

### Baseline values

To ensure a robust and representative sampling design, baseline values were derived from existing evidence on key outcomes in Northern Central America. These values serve as essential parameters for estimating sample sizes that reflect the region’s complex socio-economic and environmental dynamics. By guiding the Minimum Detectable Effects (MDEs) calculation for each outcome, these baseline values ensure that the sample size is adequate to detect meaningful differences across critical strata, such as fragility typologies, and gender. This evidence-based approach strengthens the reliability and validity of the sampling design, ensuring it is closely aligned with the realities and diversity of the target. The table below summarizes the key baseline values for the sampling process.


### Table 1. Baseline Values and Data Sources for Sampling Design

| **Type** | **Variable / Dimension** | **Notes / Source** | **Value<br>(× 100 %)** |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Outcome** | Proportion of households reporting migration intention *(binary)* | Several studies examine the desire to migrate; the most recent regional report excludes Nicaragua. — *International Organization for Migration (IOM), 2022* | **0.35** |
| **Outcome** | Proportion of households reporting food insecurity *(binary)* | Literature reports different prevalence rates.<br>Reference values used in this estimation:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Guatemala – 41 % (Deza & Ruiz-Arranz, 2022)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Honduras – 39 % (Deza & Ruiz-Arranz, 2022)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• El Salvador – 52 % (Deza & Ruiz-Arranz, 2022)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Dry Corridor (GT, HN, SV) – 43 % (WFP, 2017) | **0.41** *(average)* |
| **Outcome** | Average dietary-diversity score *(continuous)* | No systematic regional study. Evidence links food insecurity with low dietary diversity.<br>Reference: mean score = **5.6** in eight Latin-American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela) — *Gómez et al., 2019* | **5.0** *(average)* |
| **Stratum** | Proportion of female-headed households | Estimates suggest **30 – 40 %** of households in Central America are female-headed. | **0.35** |
| **Stratum** | Proportion of households living in fragile **Type I** areas – high climate risk **and** high conflict-affected levels | — | **0.38** |
| **Stratum** | Proportion of households living in fragile **Type II** areas – high climate risk and **high** conflict-affected levels | Own calculation based on **LandScan Global Population Database (2024)** | **0.11** |
| **Stratum** | Proportion of households living in fragile **Type III** areas – low climate risk **and** high conflict-affected levels | — | **0.40** |
| **Stratum** | Proportion of households living in fragile **Type IV** areas – low climate risk **and** low conflict-affected levels | — | **0.11** |

Given numerous unobservable factors, the sampling design integrates existing evidence on the explanatory power of key covariates for the selected outcome variables. To achieve this, relevant literature and studies were reviewed to identify the contributions of household-level and geographical covariates to the outcomes of interest. These covariates typically include household head characteristics, such as age, gender, education, employment status, and regional and community-level fixed effects. Incorporating these controls enhances the sampling design by addressing potential confounding variables, thereby ensuring that the model's explanatory power is robust and reflective of the diverse contexts within Northern Central America. The table below provides a summary of these considerations.

Once the sampling size is defined, the following decision is the composition of the number of villages and households. The optimal number of villages in the sampling design is determined by balancing statistical power and logistical feasibility. To achieve this, the design minimizes the design effect—a factor that reduces the effective sample size due to intra-cluster correlation (ICC). The trade-off lies between the number of clusters and the number of households per cluster: fewer clusters with more households increase ICC effects, reducing statistical efficiency, while more clusters with fewer households mitigate these effects but increase logistical complexity and costs. The optimal cluster size is reached when the effective sample size is maximized, and the benefits of adding more clusters begin to show diminishing returns. Practical considerations, such as field costs, accessibility of villages, and survey feasibility, further refine this balance. Simulations based on the study's parameters help identify this optimal point, ensuring robust statistical inference and operational efficiency. In most studies with moderate ICC (e.g., 0.05–0.15), the number of households per cluster typically ranges between 10 and 20, with the total number of clusters adjusted based on the overall sample size and stratification requirements.

### Power calculation

A simulation strategy explored how sample size requirements vary with different effect sizes across these strata. By varying the MDE thresholds for each outcome, the simulation estimated the sample sizes needed to achieve sufficient power under different scenarios. The simulation results were stratified by fragility typology, gender, and ethnicity, demonstrating the trade-offs between effect size, sample size, and statistical power.

| **Parameter** | **Specification** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Outcome variables** | 1. **Food security** (binary)<br>2. **Migration intention** (binary)<br>3. **Dietary‑diversity score** (continuous) |
| **Significance level** (\(\alpha\)) | **0.05** (95 % confidence) |
| **Statistical power** (1 – \(\beta\)) | **80 %** |
| **Oversampling rate** | **10 %** |
| **Primary / secondary sampling units (strata)** | **4 fragility levels** &nbsp;+&nbsp; **gender** |
| **Cluster (primary sampling unit)** | **Villages** |
| **Ultimate sampling units** | **Households** |


The simulation results were visualized to show how sample size changes with MDE values for each outcome. These visualizations included separate lines for fragility, gender, and ethnic strata to illustrate how representation and power are maintained across diverse subgroups. This approach ensures that the final sampling design is comprehensive and inclusive, capturing the realities and challenges of distinct population groups in Northern Central America. A simulation strategy explored how sample size requirements change with different effect sizes across strata, including fragility typologies, gender, and ethnic groups. This simulation uses varying MDE values reflecting different hypothesized effect sizes to estimate the sample size needed to achieve sufficient power under each scenario. The simulation results were visualized to illustrate the relationship between effect size and sample size for each outcome variable, enabling a clear understanding of the sample.
